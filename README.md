# Frogger
Solo project. I had one week to build my version of the Frogger game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My theme for my Frogger game was loosely based on the Baby’s Day Out movie where the baby needs to reach the parents in the game whilst avoiding obstacles.
## Game Link
[Live deployment](https://ttamanna1.github.io/Babys-Day-Out/)
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
## Brief
- Choose and create a game from a specified list of classic games. (I chose Frogger).
- Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the game.
- The game should be playable by one player.
- The obstacles should be auto generated.
## Build Process
### Planning
**Day 1:** I created my wireframe for the basic layout of my game. I then planned out and wrote my pseudocode for what I think I will need to code for my game. I went over my wireframe and pseudocode with my instructional lead.

This was my initial wireframe that I created for the basic layout of my game. I wanted a 7 by 7 grid for my game which will contain the obstacles. I wanted a start and reset button at the bottom of the game. The start button would be hidden once it has been clicked and the reset button will appear. When the reset button is clicked, it will be hidden and the start button will appear. At this point, I decided on my theme to be loosely based on the Baby’s Day Out movie. The obstacles would be moving vehicles and the target is for the baby to reach home (parents).

Next I planned out the pseudocode for my JavaScript including all the variables I may need, the main game loop where collision is detected, functions to move obstacles, win and lose conditions, event listeners (keydown event, start and reset, mute and unmute), possible functions needed. All pseudocode can be found in the game.js file in the scripts folder.

**Day 2:** I decided on the theme and researched a few basic images for the baby and obstacles. I then set out to create my grid by writing basic HTML for the frame of my game and then creating the grid in JavaScript.

I started testing out some functions for the movement of my obstacles and this is where I encountered my first challenge; my obstacles would not move and my grid system got disrupted. I tried troubleshooting by adding and altering the css and by altering my functions.

**Day 3:** After taking a break, I decided to think of an alternative way where I could possibly make it work, therefore I decided to create my grid using HTML and CSS instead of JavaScript. I added more code to my HTML so I can access it in CSS and JavaScript. I created a new function that would allow my obstacles to move in my game and made it auto generate by adding a setInterval.

Once I got this working, I added the main user function of a keydown event, where the user can control the position of the baby on the grid using arrow keys.

I added the rest of my functions to detect collision (lose condition) and win condition. I added my event listeners for the buttons and the keydown event.

**Day 4:** I focused on adding CSS and animations using keyframes. I adjusted some functions that would display a popup after a win or lose condition and continued to work more on the CSS styling.

**Day 5 and 6:** I fine tuned my CSS and troubleshooted any bugs in my JavaScript functions. I then proceeded to add a mute/unmute button and this led me having to alter some of my other functions to accommodate for this new feature. I tested out my game to check for any more bugs and tried to resolve them if I encountered any.

**Day 7:** Presentation day.
This is my game on page load and it has instructions on how to play the game:

The instructions are a popup and will be hidden when the Start Game button is clicked.

When the Start Game button is clicked, the game starts and the obstacle movement is autogenerated using a setInterval function. The user can use the arrow keys to move the baby on the grid.

When the baby collides with an obstacle, a life is lost and the Lives display is updated. A popup informs the user that they have lost a life. This popup is on a timer of 2 seconds using the setTimeout function. During this time, the keydown event listener is removed so the user cannot move the baby on the grid. The keydown event listener is added once the setTimeout is completed.

When the user loses all 3 lives, the game is stopped and a popup displays a game over image and plays a sound. Background audio is stopped.

If the user wins the game, a popup display and sound confirms the win and the image of the parents changes into a heart gif to indicate that the baby has reached the parents. On a win condition, the background music continues to play unless it has been muted by the user.

The game can be reset by clicking the Reset Game button at any time after the Start Game button has been clicked.

## Challenges
The challenge I experienced was getting the obstacles to move on the grid without affecting the grid. Originally, I created the grid in JavaScript. However, I experienced many issues where my obstacles would not move and the grid layout would be affected. I then tried a different approach where I created the grid using HTML and CSS instead and created a different function to move the obstacles. This alternative approach was much easier for me to implement obstacle movement without affecting the grid.

## Wins
My win was resolving the main challenge at the start of the project where I could not get my grid and obstacle movement to function. I took a step back and rectified this issue by considering and implementing a different approach rather than spending countless hours and days to figure out how to make the current approach work. I was proud once my initial grid and obstacle movement was complete. At each stage, when adding new snippets of code and testing it would work, there were other issues where the new snippets of code would affect other areas of the game. I was able to solve the issues and amend the code to make it function with the rest of the game. For example, I added my mute/unmute background music button last with a simple function. Although it should have been quite simple, it would not function properly. I was able to identify why it would not function as intended as there are other areas of my code that accesses and alters the use of the background music, for example, when a user loses a life the background music is paused and a life lost sound is played. Therefore, I added or amended code in each section that involves the background music so the function of muting and unmuting the background music button would work.

## Key Learnings
- Learned how to use CSS animations.
- I am getting more comfortable using JavaScript.
- Learned how to add audio functionality to my game.
- Learned how to use popups in my game.

## Improvements
I would like to add more levels as it is currently a one level game. Each additional level will increase in difficulty. Possible ways to do this is to increase the speed of obstacles, increase the number of obstacles, change the pattern of the moving obstacles and to increase the size of the grid. When additional levels are added, I would also like a score display so the user can see how many levels they won and in turn, have a high score display with data saved on localStorage. My JavaScript code could also do with refactoring.
